[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-5)

## Overview

Create download buttons and functionality that allow users to save all outputs from the processing pipeline: transcription text, translation text, original audio, and synthesized Spanish audio.

## Problem Statement

Users need the ability to download and save the results of their processing session for later use, reference, or sharing.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to download the English transcription as a text file
- As a user, I want to download the Spanish translation as a text file
- As a user, I want to download the original extracted audio file
- As a user, I want to download the synthesized Spanish audio file

## Technical Approach

- Create download button components with proper file handling
- Implement client-side file download using browser APIs
- Generate appropriate filenames with proper extensions
- Handle different file types (text, audio)

## UX/UI Considerations

- Clear download buttons with descriptive labels
- Visual feedback during download preparation
- Organized layout grouping related downloads
- Responsive button layout

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Transcription Download**: Downloads English transcription as .txt file
2. **Translation Download**: Downloads Spanish translation as .txt file
3. **Original Audio Download**: Downloads extracted audio file
4. **Synthesized Audio Download**: Downloads Spanish audio file
5. **File Naming**: Generates descriptive filenames for each download
6. **Responsive Design**: Download buttons work properly on all devices
7. **TypeScript Types**: Proper type definitions for download functionality

## Dependencies

- Generated files from processing pipeline
- Browser download APIs

## Open Questions

- What audio format should we use for downloads (MP3, WAV)?
- Should we include metadata in downloaded files?

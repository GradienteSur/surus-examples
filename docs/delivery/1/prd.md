# PBI-1: YouTube URL Input Interface

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-1)

## Overview

Create a clean and intuitive interface for users to input YouTube URLs as the starting point of the audio translation pipeline. This component serves as the primary entry point for the application.

## Problem Statement

Users need a simple, reliable way to provide YouTube video URLs to the system. The interface must validate URLs, provide clear feedback, and handle various YouTube URL formats while maintaining a professional appearance suitable for deployment.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to easily paste or type a YouTube URL into a clearly labeled input field
- As a user, I want immediate feedback on whether my URL is valid before submitting
- As a user, I want clear error messages if my URL is invalid or unsupported

## Technical Approach

- Create a React component using Next.js App Router
- Implement client-side URL validation for YouTube URLs
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern styling
- Include TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## UX/UI Considerations

- Clean, minimalist design focused on the input field
- Prominent submit button with loading states
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Error states with helpful messaging
- Success states with visual confirmation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **URL Input Field**: A clearly labeled input field accepts YouTube URLs
2. **Validation**: Real-time validation of YouTube URL format (youtube.com)
3. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid URLs or unsupported formats
4. **Responsive Design**: Works properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
6. **Loading States**: Visual feedback when processing begins
7. **TypeScript Types**: Proper type definitions for all props and state

## Dependencies
- Next.js 15 project setup
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- TypeScript configuration
- React hooks for state management

## Open Questions
- Should we support playlist URLs or only individual videos?
- What specific YouTube URL validation rules should we implement?
- Should we extract video metadata (title, duration) immediately upon URL entry?

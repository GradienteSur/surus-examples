# PBI-4: Audio Player Components

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-4)

## Overview

Create audio player components that allow users to play and control both the original extracted audio and the synthesized Spanish audio output.

## Problem Statement

Users need intuitive audio controls to listen to both the original audio and the translated Spanish audio, with standard playback controls and clear labeling to distinguish between the two audio sources.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to play the original extracted audio from the YouTube video
- As a user, I want to play the synthesized Spanish audio translation
- As a user, I want standard audio controls (play, pause, seek, volume)
- As a user, I want to clearly identify which audio player is for which content

## Technical Approach

- Create reusable React audio player components
- Use HTML5 audio elements with custom controls
- Style with Tailwind CSS for consistent appearance
- Handle audio loading states and errors

## UX/UI Considerations

- Clear labels distinguishing "Original Audio" and "Spanish Translation"
- Standard audio control layout users expect
- Visual feedback for loading and playing states
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Original Audio Player**: Plays extracted YouTube audio with clear labeling
2. **Translation Audio Player**: Plays synthesized Spanish audio with clear labeling
3. **Standard Controls**: Play, pause, seek bar, and volume controls
4. **Loading States**: Visual feedback while audio is loading
5. **Responsive Design**: Works properly on mobile and desktop
6. **TypeScript Types**: Proper type definitions for audio player props

## Dependencies

- Audio files from download and synthesis processes
- HTML5 audio API support

## Open Questions

- Should we include download buttons directly on the players?
- Should we show audio duration and current time?

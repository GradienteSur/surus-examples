# PBI-2: Real-time Progress Indicators

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-2)

## Overview

Create visual progress indicators that show users the current status of their YouTube video processing through each step of the pipeline: download, transcribe, translate, and synthesize.

## Problem Statement

Users need to understand what's happening during the processing pipeline and have confidence that the system is working. Without progress indicators, users may think the system has frozen or failed.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see which step is currently processing so I know the system is working
- As a user, I want to see completed steps so I can track overall progress
- As a user, I want visual feedback that distinguishes between pending, active, and completed states

## Technical Approach

- Create a React component that displays processing steps
- Use state management to track current step and completion status
- Style with Tailwind CSS using visual indicators (colors, icons)
- Update progress state based on API responses

## UX/UI Considerations

- Clear visual distinction between different states (pending, active, completed)
- Step labels that match the processing pipeline
- Simple, clean design that doesn't distract from main content
- Responsive layout that works on all screen sizes

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Step Display**: Shows all four steps: Download, Transcribe, Translate, Synthesize
2. **State Management**: Tracks and displays current active step
3. **Visual States**: Clear visual differences for pending, active, and completed states
4. **Responsive Design**: Works properly on mobile and desktop
5. **TypeScript Types**: Proper type definitions for progress states

## Dependencies

- React state management hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Integration with API endpoints for status updates

## Open Questions

- Should we show estimated time remaining for each step?
- Should we include error states in the progress indicator?

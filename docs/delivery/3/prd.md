[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-3)

## Overview

Create a clean interface to display the transcription and translation results, allowing users to review the text content before listening to the synthesized audio.

## Problem Statement

Users need to see and review the text results from transcription and translation in a readable, well-formatted display that makes it easy to compare original and translated content.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see the English transcription in a readable format
- As a user, I want to see the Spanish translation clearly displayed
- As a user, I want to easily distinguish between the original and translated text

## Technical Approach

- Create React components for displaying text content
- Use Tailwind CSS for typography and layout
- Implement responsive text display with proper spacing
- Include clear section headers and visual separation

## UX/UI Considerations

- Clear typography hierarchy for readability
- Visual separation between transcription and translation sections
- Responsive text layout that works on all screen sizes
- Proper spacing and margins for comfortable reading

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Transcription Display**: Shows English transcription with clear heading
2. **Translation Display**: Shows Spanish translation with clear heading
3. **Visual Separation**: Clear distinction between the two text sections
4. **Typography**: Readable font sizes and line spacing
5. **Responsive Design**: Text reflows properly on different screen sizes
6. **TypeScript Types**: Proper type definitions for text content props

## Dependencies

- Transcription and translation data from processing pipeline
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Open Questions

- Should we support text highlighting or copying?
- Should we show confidence scores from the AI models?
